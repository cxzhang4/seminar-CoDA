`seminar_paper-bacsc` contains the code for analysis, figure generation, etc.

- Files starting with `paper-` are the ones that created something discussed or used in the paper.

- `python/synthetic_null_generation` is the directory you should focus on.

    - Any BacSC code was written by Johannes, and I do not claim credit for it! I only modified it to more easily repeatable.

`seminar_paper-custom` contains the source files and figures for the actual paper.
