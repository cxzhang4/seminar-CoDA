	abstract = {In typical single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis, a clustering algorithm is applied to find putative cell types as clusters, and then a statistical differential expression (DE) test is used to identify the differentially expressed (DE) genes between the cell clusters. However, this common procedure uses the same data twice, an issue known as {\textquotedblleft}double dipping{\textquotedblright}: the same data is used to define both cell clusters and DE genes, leading to false-positive DE genes even when the cell clusters are spurious. To overcome this challenge, we propose ClusterDE, a post-clustering DE test for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of identified DE genes regardless of clustering quality. The core idea of ClusterDE is to generate real-data-based synthetic null data with only one cluster, as a counterfactual in contrast to the real data, for evaluating the whole procedure of clustering followed by a DE test. Using comprehensive simulation and real data analysis, we show that ClusterDE has not only solid FDR control but also the ability to find cell-type marker genes that are biologically meaningful. ClusterDE is fast, transparent, and adaptive to a wide range of clustering algorithms and DE tests. Besides scRNA-seq data, ClusterDE is generally applicable to post-clustering DE analysis, including single-cell multi-omics data analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing has the potential to elucidate within-population heterogeneity of prokaryotes, as well as their interaction with host systems. Despite conceptual similarities, the statistical properties of bacterial single-cell datasets are highly dependent on the protocol, making proper processing essential to tap their full potential. We present BacSC, a fully data-driven computational pipeline that processes bacterial single-cell data without requiring manual intervention. BacSC performs data-adaptive quality control and variance stabilization, selects suitable parameters for dimension reduction, neighborhood embedding, and clustering, and provides false discovery rate control in differential gene expression testing. We validated BacSC on a broad selection of bacterial single-cell datasets spanning multiple protocols and species. Here, BacSC detected subpopulations in Klebsiella pneumoniae, found matching structures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under regular and low-iron conditions, and better represented subpopulation dynamics of Bacillus subtilis. BacSC thus simplifies statistical processing of bacterial single-cell data and reduces the danger of incorrect processing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = "{Estimation of statistical associations in microbial genomic survey count data is fundamental to microbiome research. Experimental limitations, including count compositionality, low sample sizes and technical variability, obstruct standard application of association measures and require data normalization prior to statistical estimation. Here, we investigate the interplay between data normalization, microbial association estimation and available sample size by leveraging the large-scale American Gut Project (AGP) survey data. We analyze the statistical properties of two prominent linear association estimators, correlation and proportionality, under different sample scenarios and data normalization schemes, including RNA-seq analysis workflows and log-ratio transformations. We show that shrinkage estimation, a standard statistical regularization technique, can universally improve the quality of taxon–taxon association estimates for microbiome data. We find that large-scale association patterns in the AGP data can be grouped into five normalization-dependent classes. Using microbial association network construction and clustering as downstream data analysis examples, we show that variance-stabilizing and log-ratio approaches enable the most taxonomically and structurally coherent estimates. Taken together, the findings from our reproducible analysis workflow have important implications for microbiome studies in multiple stages of analysis, particularly when only small sample sizes are available.}",
