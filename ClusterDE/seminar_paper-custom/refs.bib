	abstract = {In typical single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis, a clustering algorithm is applied to find putative cell types as clusters, and then a statistical differential expression (DE) test is used to identify the differentially expressed (DE) genes between the cell clusters. However, this common procedure uses the same data twice, an issue known as {\textquotedblleft}double dipping{\textquotedblright}: the same data is used to define both cell clusters and DE genes, leading to false-positive DE genes even when the cell clusters are spurious. To overcome this challenge, we propose ClusterDE, a post-clustering DE test for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of identified DE genes regardless of clustering quality. The core idea of ClusterDE is to generate real-data-based synthetic null data with only one cluster, as a counterfactual in contrast to the real data, for evaluating the whole procedure of clustering followed by a DE test. Using comprehensive simulation and real data analysis, we show that ClusterDE has not only solid FDR control but also the ability to find cell-type marker genes that are biologically meaningful. ClusterDE is fast, transparent, and adaptive to a wide range of clustering algorithms and DE tests. Besides scRNA-seq data, ClusterDE is generally applicable to post-clustering DE analysis, including single-cell multi-omics data analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing has the potential to elucidate within-population heterogeneity of prokaryotes, as well as their interaction with host systems. Despite conceptual similarities, the statistical properties of bacterial single-cell datasets are highly dependent on the protocol, making proper processing essential to tap their full potential. We present BacSC, a fully data-driven computational pipeline that processes bacterial single-cell data without requiring manual intervention. BacSC performs data-adaptive quality control and variance stabilization, selects suitable parameters for dimension reduction, neighborhood embedding, and clustering, and provides false discovery rate control in differential gene expression testing. We validated BacSC on a broad selection of bacterial single-cell datasets spanning multiple protocols and species. Here, BacSC detected subpopulations in Klebsiella pneumoniae, found matching structures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under regular and low-iron conditions, and better represented subpopulation dynamics of Bacillus subtilis. BacSC thus simplifies statistical processing of bacterial single-cell data and reduces the danger of incorrect processing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Experimental limitations, including count compositionality, low sample sizes and technical variability, obstruct standard application of association measures and require data normalization prior to statistical estimation. Here, we investigate the interplay between data normalization, microbial association estimation and available sample size by leveraging the large-scale American Gut Project (AGP) survey data. We analyze the statistical properties of two prominent linear association estimators, correlation and proportionality, under different sample scenarios and data normalization schemes, including RNA-seq analysis workflows and log-ratio transformations. We show that shrinkage estimation, a standard statistical regularization technique, can universally improve the quality of taxon–taxon association estimates for microbiome data. We find that large-scale association patterns in the AGP data can be grouped into five normalization-dependent classes. Using microbial association network construction and clustering as downstream data analysis examples, we show that variance-stabilizing and log-ratio approaches enable the most taxonomically and structurally coherent estimates. Taken together, the findings from our reproducible analysis workflow have important implications for microbiome studies in multiple stages of analysis, particularly when only small sample sizes are available.}",

Single-cell transcriptomics data can now be complemented by chromatin accessibility, surface protein expression, adaptive immune receptor repertoire profiling and spatial information. The increasing availability of single-cell data across modalities has motivated the development of novel computational methods to help analysts derive biological insights. As the field grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to navigate the vast landscape of tools and analysis steps. Here, we summarize independent benchmarking studies of unimodal and multimodal single-cell analysis across modalities to suggest comprehensive best-practice workflows for the most common analysis steps.

Understanding all cell states requires studying isogenic bacterial populations at the single-cell level. Here we developed probe-based bacterial sequencing (ProBac-seq), a method that uses libraries of DNA probes and an existing commercial microfluidic platform to conduct bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing. We sequenced the transcriptome of thousands of individual bacterial cells per experiment, detecting several hundred transcripts per cell on average. Applied to Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, ProBac-seq correctly identifies known cell states and uncovers previously unreported transcriptional heterogeneity. In the context of bacterial pathogenesis, application of the approach to Clostridium perfringens reveals heterogeneous expression of toxin by a subpopulation that can be controlled by acetate, a short-chain fatty acid highly prevalent in the gut. Overall, ProBac-seq can be used to uncover heterogeneity in isogenic microbial populations and identify perturbations that affect pathogenicity.},

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments---the use of ``negative controls''---is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},
